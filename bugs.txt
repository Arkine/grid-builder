- Line distances not drawing when dragging a line
- Overlap Detection for when placing a line at same x|y back onto an existing line
- Line inersects are not computing line lengths properly when bisecting at 45deg (not always)
- Viewport starts on top-left bound of grid (should start in the center)
	- Doesn't align pts properly if centered
- Spacebar+click panning doesn't work unless the pan box is in focus
- Dragging a node onto an existing node mis-calculates the line dist

//TODOS
- Create visible post markers (adjust to overflow the line according to panel length)
